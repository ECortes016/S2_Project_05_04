    <h1>Local Woman Wins Marathon</h1>
    <p>

        Estes Park native Laura Blake won the 27th Front Range Marathon over an elite field
        of the best long-distance
        runners in the country. Laura's time of 2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec. was only 2 minutes off the women's course record
        set last year by Sarah Rawlings. Kathy Lasker and Lisa Peterson finished second and third, respectively.
        Laura's victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, in which she
        placed second running for Colorado State.

        In an exciting race, Peter Teagan of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the men's marathon for
        the second straight year, in a time of 2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec. Ahead for much of the race, Kyle Wills of
        Billings, Montana, finished second when he could not match Teagan's finishing pace. Jason Wu of Boulder,
        Colorado, placed third in a very competitive field.

        This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the largest field in the marathon's history, with over 9500
        men and 6700 women competing. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and temperatures that never
        exceeded 85 degrees.
